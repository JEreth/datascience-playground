## Description

This simple project deals with a data set about the iris of flowers (Fisher's Iris data set), which is a multivariate data set that describes various flower types by iris characteristics. (Learn more in the original paper https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x)

The data set is used to predict the type of flower by various attributes.

## How to use

First run the init.sh script to load the current data. You can also manually download the data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris and extract it to a data folder in this directory.

You can then go through each of the scripts and follow the idea from exploration to a ready-to-use API.
